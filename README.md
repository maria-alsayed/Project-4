Human Resources Data Analytics and Model


## Overview

The main goal of this project is to create data visualizations and data model using machine learning that will help predict an issue.

In recent years, job-switching and voluntary resignations have become more common. Employee retention can help companies/organizations save a tremendous amount of time and money. Nonetheless, more and more employees are deciding to leave their current employer, but why? To help provide employers some insight, for this project, we decided to analyze publicly available human resource data to create a data model that will predict attrition based on data/features available. Additionally, we also want to create attractive visualizations that will enable leaders within an organization gain a deeper understanding of the data.

## Built With

In looking for publicly available HR data, we were able to locate a simulated employee dataset in Kaggle.com. This dataset is in CSV format. The specific dataset contains 2,952 records. Data includes the following information:
1.	Employee ID 
2.	First Name 
3.	Last Name 
4.	Start Date
5.	Exit Date 
6.	Title
7.	Supervisor
8.	Email
9.	Business Unit
10.	Employee Status
11.	Employee Type
12.	Pay Zone
13.	Employee Classification Type
14.	Termination Type
15.	Termination Description
16.	Department Type
17.	Division Description
18.	DOB (Date of Birth) 
19.	State
20.	Job Function
21.	Gender
22.	Location
23.	Race (or) Ethnicity
24.	Marital Status
25.	Performance Score
26.	Current Employee Rating

## Data Cleanup

To begin exploring the dataset we created a Jupyter Notebook where we loaded and queried the CSV file. Using Pandas, we cleaned up the data by looking for duplicates, dropped columns that were not needed (e.g. Email), converted dates to usable formats, and converted date of birth to age. This initial data cleanup, allowed us to prepare our dataset for the data model and data visualizations.

## Data Visualizations

To help visualize our data and tell our dataâ€™s story more effectively and visually appealing to leaders of an organization, we used Tableau. [Insert what visualizations were created]
